-> If user pressed more than one conmmand(+,-,*,/) the only the first command will be taken others will be ignored. //pressedCommand is the reason for doing this.//

[x] *addNumber()* is made for taking input data. If the input is a decimal number it will multiply the old number with 10 then add them. exmp: buffer = 12, input = 5 [ (buffer x 10)+input ] = (12 x 10)+5 = 125. if the buffer is already empty then it just add the input istade of mulpication. Float number will be added as [ buffer + input/(10 x floatPosition) ].

[x] ID is used for uniquely know the button, so JS can manupulate the result as user want.
